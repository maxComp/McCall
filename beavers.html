<h3>Airplane Used to Transplant Idaho Beaver</h3>
Idaho Statesman August 26, 1948

Idaho's much aired beavers were literally up in the air near here Monday, being dropped by parachute into lakes of Idaho's primitive area.<br><br>

For years the dispute has raged in the Gem state as to whether beavers "are
worth a dam -- their own dams specifically. "  Farmers objected to them; said
their fields was being ruined by over-eager beavers building dams in irrigation canals.  Fur trappers liked the animals for their money value and conservationests because Idaho is one of the few places where they still can be found outside a zoo.<br><br>
It was finally decided to transport beavers into the primitive area where they could build dams and not hurt productive fields.<br><br>
At first they were carried in on horseback, a several day trip which tired out the beavers and tended to ruin their pelts.  Now they are being carried by plane and dropped to their destination.<br><br>
The fish and game department of Idaho is in charge of the transplanting job.  The parachute device was rigged up by the conservation district.<br><br>

The beaver are dropped from an altitude of 200 feet.  The beaver is placed in a clambshell box which is hinged at the bottom.  Two inner tubes are pulled around the box and tied together with a string.  The weight of the beaver holds the box shut during the descent, but as soon as it hits the ground the tension is released, the box opens at the top and the beaver can crawl out.
