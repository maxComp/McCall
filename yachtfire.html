sporting goods store and a cabinet maker's shop were destroyed. <br><br><b>Started in Basement</b><br>
Mrs. E. J. Peabody, owner of the building, reported the fire at 5:30 a.m. The blaze, apparently 
originating in the basement, was then out of control and by the time fire fighting equipment 
could be brought to the scene, flames prevented removal of anything from the building<br><br>
The estimated loss included the Yacht club facilities operated by Riley Joy and Roy Smythe 
of Boise; beauty shop operated by Margaret Gribble; Sportland recreation arena, a bowling 
alley, soda fountain and the H. G. Low cabinet shop.

another made ashes of an entire business block. The hotel and mill have been restored, and several 
of the Main street structures have been replaced.<br><br>
